&lt;p&gt;During my internship at Novicell, I was part of the A‑Team, the department responsible for maintaining and developing the solutions for three of Denmark&amp;rsquo;s largest e‑commerce platforms: &lt;strong&gt;Power.dk&lt;/strong&gt; (a major consumer electronics retailer), &lt;strong&gt;Biltema.dk&lt;/strong&gt; (one of the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest consumer goods chains), and &lt;strong&gt;Apoteket.dk&lt;/strong&gt; (a large national pharmacy platform). These systems experience extreme traffic spikes during events such as Black Friday and the Christmas shopping season. To support the scalability demands of these high‑throughput environments, I was tasked with a structured, scientific investigation into whether &lt;strong&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/strong&gt; could serve as a reliable core technology for message processing and load distribution. The goal was to determine its architectural suitability and ensure that the company&amp;rsquo;s systems could handle peak seasonal workloads without service degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
