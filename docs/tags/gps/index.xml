&lt;p&gt;After completing my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I transitioned from part‑time developer to full‑time Lead Software Engineer at QuadSat, a small but highly specialized company combining drone technology with RF measurement systems for satellite antenna testing. With only five employees at the time, I became responsible for architecting and implementing a new desktop application—later named the &lt;em&gt;Flight Assistant&lt;/em&gt;—designed to support technicians in the field. The goal of the application was to provide a unified tool for configuring drone flight paths, processing RF measurement data from a proprietary payload, and synchronizing telemetry from both the drone and a GPS base station.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
