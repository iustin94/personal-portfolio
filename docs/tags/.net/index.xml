&lt;p&gt;This project began as an entrepreneurial collaboration with a former colleague who worked closely with small and micro‑businesses as an accountant. Through his experience, he observed a consistent gap in the market: individuals, one‑person companies, and small enterprises lacked access to high‑quality financial and accounting tools that matched the robustness of enterprise‑grade software, yet at a price point they could afford. We set out to build a SaaS platform that delivered the same—or better—quality of functionality and engineering excellence typically reserved for large organizations, while keeping operational costs extraordinarily low. The platform was developed end‑to‑end using C# and Blazor, designed to support modern accounting workflows with the reliability, clarity, and extensibility expected of professionally engineered systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Process Modeling Platform</title><link>https://olaru.dk/projects/enterprisel-data-workbench/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://olaru.dk/projects/enterprisel-data-workbench/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at Ramboll, I worked closely with the team responsible for maintaining a decade‑old Python/Django risk management platform used across several business units. Over the years, the system had accumulated significant technical debt, with inconsistent modules, tightly coupled logic, and architectural limitations inherent to the framework and language. As new enterprise‑level requirements emerged, it became increasingly clear that the legacy platform could no longer support scalable, type‑safe, and maintainable domain modeling. In response, leadership approved a greenfield initiative—internally referred to as the &lt;em&gt;Data Workbench&lt;/em&gt;—aimed at building a modern enterprise process‑modeling platform informed by the lessons learned from maintaining the legacy codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>RabbitMQ Monitoring Framework</title><link>https://olaru.dk/projects/rabbitmq-monitoring-framework/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://olaru.dk/projects/rabbitmq-monitoring-framework/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my second internship at Novicell, I identified a significant tooling gap while conducting my earlier feasibility study on RabbitMQ for high‑throughput e‑commerce workloads. Although the .NET ecosystem offered mature libraries for publishing and consuming messages, it lacked a dedicated C# framework for &lt;strong&gt;real‑time monitoring of RabbitMQ cluster health&lt;/strong&gt;. Given the operational demands of Novicell&amp;rsquo;s A‑Team—responsible for platforms such as Power.dk, Biltema.dk, and Apoteket.dk—I proposed a focused project to design a lightweight, read‑only monitoring library capable of providing developers with live insights into RabbitMQ cluster metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
