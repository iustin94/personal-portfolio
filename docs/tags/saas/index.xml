      <title>SaaS Platform for Financial Workflows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project began as an entrepreneurial collaboration with a former colleague who worked closely with small and micro‑businesses as an accountant. Through his experience, he observed a consistent gap in the market: individuals, one‑person companies, and small enterprises lacked access to high‑quality financial and accounting tools that matched the robustness of enterprise‑grade software, yet at a price point they could afford. We set out to build a SaaS platform that delivered the same—or better—quality of functionality and engineering excellence typically reserved for large organizations, while keeping operational costs extraordinarily low. The platform was developed end‑to‑end using C# and Blazor, designed to support modern accounting workflows with the reliability, clarity, and extensibility expected of professionally engineered systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
