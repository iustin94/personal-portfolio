**Implementation projects:**

- [**Experiment Project at the Cognition and Behavior Laboratory in Aarhus**]({{< ref "experiment-orchestration-app.md" >}}): An independent project aimed at testing heart rate synchronization during shared activities, utilizing Wii remotes and biometric data collection.

- [**Message Queue System Framework at Novicell**]({{< ref "rabbitmq-monitoring-framework.md" >}}): Developed a RabbitMQ message system library for an API during a second internship.

- [**Flight Assistant Project at QuadSat**]({{< ref "flight-assistant.md" >}}): Combined a drone and payload with a Python-based desktop application and AWS-backed serverless cloud solution for satellite companies.

- [**Data Management Platform at Ramboll**]({{< ref "enterprisel-data-workbench.md" >}}): A greenfield project focused on creating a robust data management platform for enterprise clients.

- [**Blazor-Based SaaS Platform**]({{< ref "blazor-saas-platform.md" >}}): A comprehensive data management SaaS platform developed over two to three years for small to medium-sized businesses, leveraging C# and .NET, hosted on a self-hosted VPS with Hetzner, and featuring a custom rule-based simulation engine.

**Investigation**

- [**Feasibility Study of RabbitMQ at Novicell**]({{< ref "rabbitmq-feasibility-study.md" >}}): Alongside the message queue framework project, investigated the feasibility of using RabbitMQ for the company's needs and documented the findings and outcomes.

- [**Master's Research Project - Simulation Engine**]({{< ref "rule-based-simulation-engine.md" >}}): An independent research project aimed at developing and evaluating a simulation engine platform, with a focus on its use case and usability.

- [**Master's Research Project - Data Analysis Pipeline**]({{< ref "masspec-data-analysis-pipeline.md" >}}): A research-focused project that extended a data analysis pipeline, investigating the feasibility of open-source technologies for creating data workflows and presenting the advantages and challenges of this approach.
